# Java Program - Demonstrating Mammal Hierarchy

This Java program showcases the usage of a class hierarchy for various mammals. The main class "Main" contains an ArrayList of "Mamiferos" objects named "mamiferolist". It creates instances of different mammal classes such as Cachorro, Leon, Oso, Gato, Caballo, and Tigre, and adds them to the list.

The program prints the sounds and species names of each mammal in the list using a for-each loop. Each mammal class has an implementation of the "Som()" method that returns the characteristic sound of that mammal and a "nome()" method that sets the species name of the mammal.

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to organize and utilize a class hierarchy to model different types of mammals in Java.
